In order to provide a comprehensive financial analysis report, I would need to follow these steps:
1. Gather the most recent financial data for both AAPL and MSFT from reliable sources.
2. Review key financial metrics such as revenue, net income, operating cash flow, and net margin. Compare these metrics year-over-year to identify trends or significant changes.
3. Analyze the companies' financial statements to gain insights into their revenue sources, cost structures, asset management, debt levels, and cash flow generation. Look for any anomalies or significant changes.
4. Calculate and analyze important financial ratios to assess the companies' valuation, profitability, financial risk, and liquidity. Compare these ratios against industry averages or competitor benchmarks for a relative perspective.

Without the actual financial data, I couldn't provide a specific financial analysis report for AAPL and MSFT at the moment. However, these steps can serve as a guide on how to analyze their financial data comprehensively.
