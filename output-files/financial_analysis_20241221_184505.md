Based on the financial statement analysis, both Apple and Microsoft show strong financial health and performance. Apple's revenue, net income, and operating cash flow have been increasing, despite a slight decrease in revenue from 2018 to 2019. On the other hand, Microsoft has seen consistent growth in revenue and a significant increase in net income from 2018 to 2020. The financial ratios further support these findings. Apple's P/E ratio is lower than Microsoft's, indicating it could be undervalued, but its higher debt to equity ratio shows it has more debt relative to its equity. Microsoft's higher current ratio indicates better short-term liquidity. In conclusion, both companies present strong financial performance, but Microsoft seems to have a better balance in terms of profitability, debt management, and liquidity.
