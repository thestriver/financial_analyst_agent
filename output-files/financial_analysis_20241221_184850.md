After a comprehensive analysis of the financial data for AAPL and MSFT, here are my findings:

1. Key Financial Metrics:
   - AAPL: Revenue has been increasing consistently over the past few years, indicating strong sales. Net income and operating profit have also been increasing, suggesting efficient operations and good profitability. However, the company has a high level of debt, which could be a concern.
   - MSFT: Revenue and net income have also been increasing consistently, indicating strong sales and profitability. The company has a lower level of debt compared to AAPL, suggesting better financial stability.

2. Trends in Financial Statements:
   - AAPL: The company's assets have been increasing over the past few years, primarily driven by increases in cash and investments. Liabilities have also been increasing, mainly due to higher levels of debt. Shareholder equity has been relatively stable.
   - MSFT: Assets have also been increasing, primarily due to increases in cash and investments. Unlike AAPL, liabilities have been relatively stable, and shareholder equity has been increasing.

3. Significant Changes or Anomalies:
   - AAPL: There was a significant increase in revenue and net income in 2020, which could be due to the launch of new products or changes in the market. 
   - MSFT: There was a significant increase in revenue and net income in 2019, which could be due to the success of its cloud business.

4. Important Financial Ratios:
   - AAPL: The company has a high Price/Earnings ratio, indicating that it may be overvalued. The debt/equity ratio is also high, suggesting that the company relies heavily on debt financing. However, the return on equity is high, indicating good profitability.
   - MSFT: The company has a lower Price/Earnings ratio, indicating that it may be undervalued. The debt/equity ratio is low, suggesting that the company has a good balance between debt and equity financing. The return on equity is also high, indicating good profitability.

In conclusion, both AAPL and MSFT have strong financial performance, with increasing revenue and net income. However, AAPL has a higher level of debt, which could be a concern. On the other hand, MSFT has a lower P/E ratio, indicating that it may be undervalued.
